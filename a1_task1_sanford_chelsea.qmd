# Task 1: Data Wrangling & Visualization: Sierra Amphibians

## Overview: 

**Data summary:** Exploring amphibian abundance data recorded by the Sierra Lakes Inventory Project. 
From the Environmental Data Initiative repository: “The Sierra Lakes Inventory Project (SLIP) was a research endeavor that ran from 1995-2002 and has supported research and management of Sierra Nevada aquatic ecosystems and their terrestrial interfaces. We described the physical characteristics of and surveyed aquatic communities for >8,000 lentic water bodies in the southern Sierra Nevada, including lakes, ponds, marshes, and meadows. In this document, I explore Mountain Yellow-Legged Frog abundance in the Sierra Lakes Region from 1995-2002 as well as determining which lakes had the 5 highest abundances of adult frogs.”

## Load in the Data

```{r}
amphibians_data <- read_excel(here('data', 'sierra_amphibians.xlsx'))
```

## Part 1: Mountain Yellow-Legged Frog Life Stages

#### 1. Filter for *rana muscosa,* and use lubridate to edit date.

```{r}
mylf_data <- amphibians_data %>% 
  select('survey_date', 'amphibian_species', 'amphibian_life_stage', 'amphibian_number') %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  filter(amphibian_species == 'RAMU', amphibian_life_stage != 'EggMass') %>% 
  mutate(year = lubridate::year(survey_date))

mylf_data$year <- factor(mylf_data$year)
```

#### 2. Group by year and lifestage.

```{r}
mylf_year <- mylf_data %>% 
  group_by(year, amphibian_life_stage) %>% 
  summarise(amphibian_number = sum(amphibian_number, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

#### 3. Bar Graph of Mountain Yellow-Legged Frog Counts from 1995-2002.

```{r}
mylf_plot <- ggplot(data = mylf_year, 
                    aes(x = year, y = amphibian_number, fill = amphibian_life_stage)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c('aquamarine', 'darkcyan', 'darkslategrey')) +
  labs(x = "Year", 
       y = "Number of Amphibians") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank(), axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 0.1))
```

## Part 2: Mountain Yellow-Legged Frog Adult and Sub-Adult Counts

#### 1. Filter and group by lakes.

```{r}
mylf_adult <- amphibians_data %>% 
  select('lake_id', 'survey_date', 
         'amphibian_species', 'amphibian_life_stage', 'amphibian_number') %>%  
  clean_names() %>% 
  filter(amphibian_species == 'RAMU', amphibian_life_stage != 'EggMass', amphibian_life_stage != 'Tadpole') %>% 
  mutate(year = lubridate::year(survey_date))

mylf_adult$year <- factor(mylf_adult$year)
```

#### 2. Identify and isolate the lakes with highest frog count.

```{r}
mylf_count <- mylf_adult %>% 
  group_by(lake_id) %>% 
  summarize(amphibian_number = sum (amphibian_number, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ungroup()

mylf_5 <- mylf_count %>% 
  top_n(5, wt = amphibian_number) %>% 
  mutate(lake_id = paste('Lake', lake_id, sep = ' ')) %>% 
  mutate(lake_id = fct_reorder(lake_id, amphibian_number))
```

#### 3. Plot the Mountain Yellow-Legged frog counts by lake.

```{r fig.cap = ' '}
mylf_lake_plot <- ggplot(data = mylf_5, aes(x = lake_id, y = amphibian_number)) +
  geom_col(fill = "cyan3") +
  labs(x = 'Lake', y = 'Number of Amphibians') +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 0.5, hjust= 0.1))
```

## Create a combined plot.

```{r fig.cap = 'Figure 1. The two bar graphs depict Mountain Yellow-Legged Frog abundance from 1995-2002. Panel A shows Mountain Yellow-Legged Frog count at three life stages (tadpole, subadult, and adult life stages) over the 7-year period. There is a distinct increase in abundance at all lifes stages, with a significant increase in 2002. Panel B depicts combined Mountain Yellow-Legged Frog abundance summed over the 7-year period. Shown above are the 5 lakes with the highest overall adult and subadult life stages. Counts range from 1500-2500.'}
figure1 <- mylf_plot + mylf_lake_plot

figure1 + plot_annotation(tag_levels = "A", title = 'Mountain Yellow-Legged Frog Counts in the Sierra Lakes')

```
